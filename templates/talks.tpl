<h4>First Class Functions <em>(Chas Keichner)</em></h4>
<p>Come to the first talk of the semester! It's an introduction to first-class functions, and why you should care that functions are no longer second-class citizens. The language is Javascript, but should be understandable even without Javascript experience. The talk is aimed at people who know what functions are, but don't know why you would make a function that took a function as an argument. Come back to ACM to share your love of computing!</p>
