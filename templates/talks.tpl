    <h4>An Introduction to Monads<em>(Chris Van Horne)</em></h4>
    <p>
    Continuing from the "Haskell in 15 Minutes" talk from last week,
    Chris will cover monads and remove some of their mystique. The talk
    will give the rationale of monads in a pure lazy functional
    language like Haskell. The Wadler interpreter will be the vehicle
    of discovery for derivation of two standard Haskell monads: 
    <code>Maybe</code> and 
    <code>Writer</code>. This talk should be considered
    advanced, but the high-level concepts appropriate for a 200-level CSc student. <a href='static/talks/monads-acm-spring12.pdf'>Download this PDF.</a></p>

    <h4>Git: rm *.old <em>(Chas Leichner)</em></h4>

    version control is and why we use it, how to do basic operations 
    with git, how to use git to collaborate with others, and the basics 
    of github.
