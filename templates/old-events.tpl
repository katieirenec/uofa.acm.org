  <h4>ISTA 420/520 Applied CI Concepts</h4>
  <p>This class will count towards a CSc tech-elective and is three units. It aims to to
  provide topics on large data storage, analysis, distribution, and visualization. You get
  hands on experience with tools that power many CI projects, as well as collaborate with
  other students to solve interesting case-dilemmas in class. If you're interested,
  <a href='http://goo.gl/p4j3m'>then apply online.</a></p>


  <time datetime='2012-04-235T6:00-17:00'>April 23 from 6:00-7:00PM in GS-907</time>
  <h4>iPlant</h4>
  <p>The iPlant Collaborative aims to solve large data problems in biology; everything from transfer, storage, analysis, visualization, meta-data mark-up, searching and discovering, sharing and collaborating, and publishing. Their stack includes GWT, Clojure, Python, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and more--all open source and on <a href='https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource'>GitHub</a>. Check out their <a href='http://goo.gl/eFHeX'>slides and go apply for an internship</a> while they're still available.</p>



  <time datetime='2012-03-25T12:15-17:00'>March 25th at 12:00-5:00PM in GS-907</time>
  <h4>WICS Basic Programming Workshop</h4>
  <p>The University of Arizona Women in Computer Science (WICS) will be hosting
  a programming seminar for those interested in diving into Python, Matlab, and
  more. There are volunteering opportunities as well as the chance to learn
  something new.</p>
  <h5>Python Intro</h5>
  <p>Learn Python from scratch, from the download to arithmetic to variables 
  to loops to file IO. This is the same as the Intro Python workshop offered 
  on March 4. Installation and snacks: 12:00-12:15pm. Class: 12:15-1:15pm.</p>

  <h5>Applying Python</h5>
  <p>In this workshop, we will dive a little deeper into Python, and also 
  apply it to solve a real-world scientific task. Lists, dictionaries, more 
  advanced loops, and more practice problems, including parsing a file and 
  probably an alternative task if you hate file parsing. Class: 1:30-2:30pm.</p>

  <h5>MATLAB Intro</h5>
  <p>Loaded with features, MATLAB makes number crunching quick and easy to 
  visualize. Used extensively in many industries, from engineering to computer 
  vision. Learn MATLAB from scratch, including the development environment, 
  (array) variables, loops, scripts, and many built-in functions.
  Installation, if needed: 3:00-3:30pm.
  MATLAB basics: 3:30-5:00pm</p>

  <time datetime='2012-03-30T06:00:00-07:00'>March</time>
  <h4>2nd Annual Spring Programming Competition</h4>
  <p>The Spring 2012 programming competition has yet to be determined, but talks have started addressing the topic and style of the 2<sup>nd</sup> annual "University of Arizona ACM Spring Programming Competition".</p>
  <p>The previous year's competition was in the style of ICPC without the language limitations, but there have been recent suggestions to create a single project that teams can hack on. We expect to finalize the competition details, sponsors, and date within the month.</p>



  <time datetime='2012-03-07T05:00:00-06:00'>March 7 at 5PM in ECE530</time>
  <h4>JPEG2000 <em>(Dr. Michael W. Marcellin)</em></h4>
  <p><a href='http://www2.engr.arizona.edu/~mwm/'>Dr. Marcellin</a>
  will be giving a survey introduction to 
  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG_2000'>JPEG2000</a> including
  an overview and demonstrations. JPEG2000 provides a standard for superior 
  image compression performance, data streaming at multiple resolutions, 
  specific region of interest, and both lossy and lossless compression.</p>

  <h2>ACM and Friends Sponsored Events</h2>
